After setting up the ORB docker, your database does not include any documents. Documents can be articles, podcasts, messages, newsletters etc. In this tutorial you will learn how to add documents to the database. The API endpoint ORB provides an API endpoint to add documents. You can add articles by doing a POST request: POST http://localhost:8000/article/ You can send the following data to the endpoint (as a JSON): { \"title\": \"That's a title\", \"teaser\": \"That's a teaser\", \"fullext\": \"That's a fulltext\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/\", \"content_type\": \"article\", \"created\": \"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z\" } None of the fields is mandatory. If successful, the API sends the status 201 Created . Examples In this section you will find examples how to add send requests to the API. a) Adding a document with Postman You can add a document with Postman . Postman is a program to test APIs. Create a POST request, include the body as a JSON and send the document to the API as seen in the picture. b) Adding a document with Python You can automate adding documents with the Python Request Library . Install the library. pip install requests Run the following code to add a document: import requests document = { \"title\": \"That's a title\", \"teaser\": \"That's a teaser\", \"fullext\": \"That's a fulltext\", \"url\": \"https://example.com/\", \"content_type\": \"article\", \"created\": \"2012-04-23T18:25:43.511Z\" } r = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/article/', json=document) print(r.status_code)","title":"How to add documents to the database?"},{"location":"add_documents/#how-to-add-documents-to-the-database","text":"After setting up the ORB docker, your database does not include any documents.

Open Recommendation Butler comes prepared for deployment. For deployment, we use NGINX and Gunicorn. Both come ready configured with this repository. We will user docker-compose.prod.yml instead of docker-compose.yml to set up the Docker. Requirements You need a deployment server with Docker and Git installed and root rights. Optionally, you need a registered domain. Alternativelly, you can access ORB via the IP adress of your server. Setting up the docker Clone the repository git clone https://github.com/open-recommendation-butler/ORB.git Change directory to project directory cd ORB Create a file with the name \".env\". Insert the following content into the \".env\" file. Replace YourStrongPasswordForElasticSearch , YourStrongPasswordForKibana and YourStrongSecretKeyForDjango with your own passwords. Replace example.org with your domain or IP adress. Content of \".env\" file: # Password for the 'elastic' user (at least 6 characters) ELASTIC_PASSWORD=YourStrongPasswordForElasticSearch # Password for the 'kibana_system' user (at least 6 characters) KIBANA_PASSWORD=YourStrongPasswordForKibana # Secret key for Django (at least 6 characters) SECRET_KEY=YourStrongSecretKeyForDjango # Turn off Django's debug mode.

Securing ORB with SSL (optional) You can secure the access to ORB with SSL. To do so, we will create a certificate with Let's encrypt and certbot . To do so, run the following command on the server. Remember to replace YourMailAdress and YourDomain . It's recommended to use a working mail adress. You will receive a notification if your certificate expires. docker exec orb-nginx-1 certbot --nginx -n --agree-tos -m YourMailAdress -d YourDomain Hint: This certificate will expire after 3 months.

Each record in the dataset consists of the following attributes: - category: category in which the article was published. - headline: the headline of the news article. - authors: list of authors who contributed to the article. - link: link to the original news article. - short_description: Abstract of the news article. - date: publication date of the article. We will add those attributes to the database. Requirements ORB is up and running. See: How to get started A kaggle account. It's free: Register at Kaggle An API key from Kaggle.
